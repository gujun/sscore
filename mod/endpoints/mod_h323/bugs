faststart and codecs v CallProceeding due to h323plus, grep "Very Frustrating - S.H." in h323plus 
source and uncomment commented lines.


exploration form developer of h323plus:

Yes that should be mera.

The problem is that Callproceeding does not always come from the remote it
may be generated by the gatekeeper. MERA where sending fast start elements
in the Call proceeding and connect. The call proceeding where not valid and
causing the media to fail. Normally (although valid) EP's do not set Fast
Start in Call proceeding so the code was disabled to resolve the MERA issue.
